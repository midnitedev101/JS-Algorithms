/***** Graphs *****/

Graph Definition:

A graph is represented as a set of objects where some pair of objects
are connected by links. The individual objects are represented by points aka
"vertices" and the links are called "edges".

          A         B
          o---------o
          |         |
          |         |
          |         |
          o---------o---------o
          C         D         E

V = {a, b, c, d, e}
E = {ab, ac, bd, cd, de}

Two nodes are "adjacent" to each other when they are connected through an edge.
B is adjacent to A and D, E is adjacent to D, and D is adjacent to B, C, and E.

"Paths" represent a sequence of edged between 2 vertices. ABCD represents a
path from A to D.

Graphs are divided these categories:

1) Directed Graph - Edged have direction
2) Undirected Graph - Edges does not represent any direction

Ways to represent graphs:

1) Adjacency Matrix

  A 2-dimensional matrix in which the rows represent source vertices and
  columns represent destination vertices.

      A B C D E
    -----------
  A | 0 1 1 0 0
  B | 1 0 0 1 0
  C | 1 0 0 1 0
  D | 0 1 1 0 1
  E | 0 0 0 1 0

2) Adjacency List

  Vertices are stored as records or objects and every vertex stores a list of
  adjacent vertices.

  a is adjacent to b, c
  b is adjacent to a, d
  c is adjacent to a, d
  d is adjacent to b, c, e
  e is adjacent to d

3) Incidence Matrix

  A 2-dimensional boolean matrix in which the rows represent the vertices and
  columns represent the edges.

  If graph is presented like this:

        A   e1    B
        o---------o
        |         |
    e2  |         | e3
        |         |
        o---------o---------o
        C   e4    D   e5    E

  Then its incidence matrix is represented like this:

          e1  e2  e3  e4  e5
        --------------------
      A | 1   1   0   0   0
      B | 1   0   1   0   0
      C | 0   1   0   1   0
      D | 0   0   1   1   1
      E | 0   0   0   0   1
